52593,Compose a magazine article for ‘Cold War Quarterly’ analyzing the CIA document on Khrushchev’s thinking and how it led to the crisis.,"Title: Khrushchev’s Gambit: The Calculated Risk That Shook the WorldIn 1962, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev shocked the globe by stationing nuclear missiles just 90 miles from Florida. As outlined in the CIA’s report “CUBA 1962: Khrushchev’s Miscalculated Risk,” Moscow viewed this bold move as a shortcut to strategic parity. The Soviets assumed that Washington’s response would be limited, especially if the operation stayed covert until completion. However, the plan unraveled. The CIA’s reconnaissance flights photographed the missile installations, forcing President John F. Kennedy into a decisive stance. The resulting 13-day standoff became the Cuban Missile Crisis, arguably the closest humanity has come to nuclear Armageddon. Khrushchev, overestimating both Cuban support and American reluctance to engage, found his hand weaker than expected. Ultimately, secret negotiations led to the missiles’ removal, preserving global peace but damaging the Soviet leader’s reputation. Today, historians point to Khrushchev’s misreading of U.S. resolve as a cautionary tale of how intelligence estimates—and the assumptions behind them—can spark high-stakes brinkmanship.",61412019-7b00-44ae-9663-54fdf71cd5c0,30,classic
